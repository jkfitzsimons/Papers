# Papers

##A repository for paper summaries.

I am trying to get into the habit of summarising the papers I read on different topics into short notes or extended abstracts. This repo will hopefully fill up over time. Others also interested in helping grow the repo please join in.

##Organisation

There are subfolders for each topic. If the paper does not fit into a particular subfolder then just create a new one.
